# PersonalizedDesktop


I finally completed the first version of PERSONALIZED DESKTOP.

It is an interface which resembles our desktop where you can access almost everything on your pc from a single screen....

The current version of desktop is simple with very few functionalities but in development the next version of desktop I am planning to add a few machine learning models and few applications and games which are self personalized and developed.

This application is developed using Python and GUI is developed using Tkinter.

There are various other python libraries used for various tasks.

Current version of desktop has following features-

1. It can displays the top news headlines...(In news section- Top left side)

2. It continuously checks and update the current weather of your city

3. It can open the particular application when clicked

4. It continuously shows and updates Battery, RAM and CPU status

5. It can directly play songs from a specified directory

6. With a search bar provided at right side you can directly search on the web

7. To control volume and brightness, buttons are provided

and many more...



The future versions of desktop would include few personalized games and applications and also few machine learning models would be deployed for various tasks(Its the best part)
